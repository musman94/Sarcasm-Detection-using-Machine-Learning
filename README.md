# Sarcasm Detection using Machine Learning
Done as a course project for my Machine Learning course in a group of 4 people. The aim of the project was to detect sarcasm in comments using Naive Bayes and SVM and then compare the results of both of the models. We used a dataset from kaggle for training our models.

The dataset contains 1.3 million sarcastic comments collected from Reddit. Features used for training the models were hyperboles, exclamation marks, capitalisations, emoticons, sentiments, lexical features such as unigrams, bigrams, POS tags and topics. In the end the SVM classifier came out to be the winner with an accuracy of 64%.
